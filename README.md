A simple game of Asteroids created with pygame for Boot.dev.

# Original Scope
- An asteroid field that spawns asteroids of 3 different sizes. 
- The player can navigate the field and shoot to destroy asteroids.
- Collision of the player and an asteroid termintates the game, while a bullet and an asteroid destroys both objects. 
- If the asteroid is larger than the smallest size, then two new asteroids are spawned.

# Planned upgrades
 - Make the objects (especially the player) wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
 - Add a scoring system
 - Add a HuD for informational display.
 - Implement multiple lives and respawning
